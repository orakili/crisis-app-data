4.7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Chad, including more than 1 million expected to be severely food insecure across the country in June.  The country faces security threats

Attacks have targeted both military operations and civilians, driving people from their homes. Around 130,000 people are displaced in Lac region. Nigerian refugees have been crossing into Chad since 2014, further adding to large refugee populations from Sudan in the east, and Central African Republic in the south.Underlying vulnerability and food insecurity is high, particularly in the Sahelian zone to the north of the country.INFORM measures Chad's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster at 7.76/10, up from 6 in 2016. Hazard and exposureVulnerability as well as lack of coping capacity are of particular concern, at 7.2.4/10 and

Conflict is between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, and mainly impacting the eastern provinces. Although the security situation has improved slightly since 2013, conflict continues. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country. Fighting in insecurity is currently mostly affecting populations in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Health is a priority due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high.A presidential election is due in 2017, and it has been agreed that President Kabila, whose term limit ended in December 2016, will then step down. At least 50 people died in election-related violence in 2016. INFORM measures DRC's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7/10. Lack of coping capacity is of particular concern, at 8/10 as well as vulnerability at

state of emergency was declared on 8 October following large-scale anti-government protests. The protests started in November 2015, and Ethiopian government forces have killed at least 800 demonstrators in 2016. Consecutive, below-average rainy season yields for the Gu (from March to May) and Deyr (October to December) seasons have caused severe drought across northern, eastern, and central Ethiopia.   This is leading to high levels of food insecurity, particularly in Afar, in Sitti zone of Somali region, and parts of Amhara, Oromia, and SNNPR. Malnutrition has increased significantly.  Below-average rainfall is projected for the Belg season, which will affect the drought in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country.  Hosting over 781,000 refugees from neighbouring countries, including over 320,000 from South Sudan, the majority of Ethiopia’s refugee camps have reached full capacity. Overcrowding, malnutrition, and critical shortfalls in humanitarian aid are of concern. Most refugees have been in protracted displacement, but remain in need of assistance.INFORM measures Ethiopia's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 6.4/10. Vulnerability is of particular concern, at 6.6/10. ","date":"2017-03-17T13:42:49.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/ethiopia"},"iso3":"ETH","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/eth","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/eth.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/eth.png","figures":[{"name":"People

(IS) took over significant portions of Iraqi territory, triggering mass displacement and severe humanitarian needs. After a military stalemate throughout much of 2015, government operations to retake territory from IS were stepped up in 2016 and are ongoing in 2017, aggravating displacement and humanitarian needs, particularly in Anbar and Mosul corridors. Access constraints and human rights violations from all warring parties are of major concern.Iraq now hosts three million IDPs, one of the largest internally displaced populations in the world. IDPs and Syrian refugees make up 25% of the population in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I).INFORM measures Iraq’s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.9/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity are of particular concern, at 7.7/10 and 7/10 rates. ","date":"2017-03-15T08:24:34.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/iraq"},"iso3":"IRQ","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/irq","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/irq.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/irq.png","figures":[{"name":"Mosul:

northeast has caused massive displacement and at the same time restricted movement: it has disrupted food supplies, seriously hindered access to basic services, and limited agricultural activities. As of January 2017, it is estimated that 14 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, 8.5 million of whom are in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. Bauchi (2.8 million people), Gombe (1.4 million), and Taraba (1.3 million) also host high numbers of people in need. In seven years of conflict, over 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram-related incidents. People affected by violence in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, and neighbouring Bauchi, Taraba, and Gombe states are in urgent need of food, access to health services, protection, and education. Since February 2016, as humanitarian access is increasing, extreme food insecurity and malnutrition conditions have been revealed in Borno state.INFORM measures Nigeria's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster as 'high', 6.3/10, and its coping capacity index is 6.6/10. ","date":"2017-03-14T16:45:33.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/nigeria"},"iso3":"NGA","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/nga","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/nga.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/nga.png","figures":[{"name":"People

fighting and a severe El Niño-induced drought, has created large-scale displacement and made basic services almost inaccessible for an estimated 6 million Somalis. The drought is causing significant loss of livelihoods across the country, and widespread displacement. Famine is possible in 2017 if humanitarian assistance is inadequate. Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly inaccessible. The government's control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. Widespread corruption, elections (September 2016-February 2017) and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of south central Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland. The INFORM index score for risk of humanitarian catastrophe ranks Somalia at 9.2 out of 10, the highest of any country. ","date":"2017-03-14T08:08:57.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/somalia"},"iso3":"SOM","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/som","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/som.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/som.png","figures":[{"name":"People

2016 there has been a surge in conflict across the country including in previously less affected areas of Central and Eastern Equatoria.

Food insecurity and malnutrition rates are unprecedented, and insecurity is hampering the delivery of assistance. The UN reports widespread violation of human rights and targeted violence against civilians.Violence spread across eastern and northern South Sudan in December 2013 after President Kiir accused Vice President Riek Machar of plotting a coup. A ceasefire was agreed in August 2015, and a transitional government set up in April 2016 but fighting continues.INFORM measures South Sudan's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster for 2017 to be extremely high, at 8.8/10, an increase from 8.3/10 in 2016. South Sudan's vulnerability is measured at 9/10.","date":"2017-03-16T12:24:49.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/south-sudan"},"iso3":"SSD","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/ssd","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/ssd.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/ssd.png","figures":[{"name":"People

groups across Darfur, and persistent conflict situations in South Kordofan and Blue Nile cause high levels of insecurity. Darfur has been the scene of conflict for over a decade, while violence in Blue Nile and South Kordofan increased significantly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011.Humanitarian access to conflict zones is severely restricted and remains so despite efforts of the AU and UN to broker a peace agreement and ensure increased humanitarian access.Violence, food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic services have caused large-scale internal displacement.Most recent floods occurred between June and September.According to INFORM, Sudan is at high risk of being overwhelmed by humanitarian crises and disasters (7/10). Hazard, vulnerability, and a lack of coping capacity are at alarming rates of 7.4/10, 6.6/10, and 7/10.

Humanitarian needs in areas under prolonged and ongoing siege are particularly high as access is obstructed.Clashes are ongoing in Dara, ar Raqqa, Homs, Deir-ez-Zor city, and Hama. After more than a month of decreased clashes between parties involved in the ceasefire, fighting has started again in mid-February between the SAA and opposition armed groups, including the FSA. The Turkish army recently increased activity in Aleppo governorate, targeting both Islamic State and the Kurdish YPG. INFORM measures Syria's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.9/10.

since March 2014, when armed conflict erupted between separatists and Ukrainian armed forces. Separatists now control most of eastern Donetsk region, and a small area of southern Luhansk region. 3.8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 2.8 million have been displaced. Protection and health are of particular concern in conflict areas, particularly as a large number of older people are affected. Humanitarian access is constrained: virtually all international aid organisations (all in Donestk) have been banned from non-government areas.  However, in September 2016 UNHCR’s license to operate in Donetsk and surrounding areas was renewed. INFORM measures Ukraine's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 5.3/10. Hazard exposure rating is also very high at 7/10.","date":"2017-03-15T09:08:52.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/ukraine"},"iso3":"UKR","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/ukr","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/ukr.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/ukr.png","figures":[{"name":"IDPs","value":"1626137","date":"2017-02-28T12:00:00Z","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1946334","source":"Government

including 10.3 million people in acute need, after fighting escalated in March 2015. An armed advance on the capital in September 2014 by Houthis from the north triggered a civil war throughout the country. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia is supporting the Yemeni government with airstrikes. Activities by southern secessionists Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State (IS) compound the security and political challenges.The humanitarian situation is further exacerbated by Yemen’s failing economy. The Central Bank in Yemen is near collapse, putting food imports at risk.The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) declared Yemen a Level 3 emergency in July 2015. INFORM measures Yemen's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster at a very high level of 7.6/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at alarming levels: 8.2/10, 7.9/10 and 7.8/10
