The ethnically diverse population of Myanmar has been under military rule from 1962 until 2011, and the military has since shared power with the government as per the 2008 constitution. On 1 February 2021, the Tatmadaw staged a military coup, declaring fraud in the November 2020 multiparty general election won by the National League for Democracy. Over 200,000 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar since 1 February. An additional two million people are in need of humanitarian assistance since the coup. More than 1.6 million IDPs and refugees remain in protracted conflict-led displacement in Chin, Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan states in Myanmar and in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>\n\n<p>Protection is a key concern across Myanmar as armed conflict and violations of international humanitarian law by the Tatmadaw and armed groups continue to affect civilians. Access to basic services is limited and livelihoods are threatened by conflict and lack of economic opportunities, particularly for the stateless Rohingya in Rakhine and for IDPs living in non-government controlled areas in northern Shan.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Myanmar's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 6.3/10</p>"}
