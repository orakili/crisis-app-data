{"name":"Overview","date":"2019-10-10T09:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","language":"en","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/ukraine","main":"<p>Since armed conflict between the government and pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk began in 2014, more than 3,000 civilians have died and some 9,000 have been injured. The conflict affects 5.2 million people in eastern Ukraine, particularly those near the contact line that divides government-controlled areas (GCAs) and non-government controlled areas (NGCAs). The majority of people in need are located in the NGCA of Luhansk and Donetsk, many of whom are elderly and more vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>Despite ceasefire agreements, violations are regularly reported and critical civilian infrastructure like water and electricity systems are frequently damaged by shelling. Hostilities and the presence of landmines hinder repairs and maintenance work, exacerbating WASH needs in NGCAs in particular. Older people are more likely to remain in these areas and are therefore disproportionally affected.? The worsening socioeconomic situation and restrictions on movement have affected access to food and basic services such as education and health, limited livelihood opportunities, and triggered the displacement of 1.5 million people.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Ukraine's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 5.2/10. Hazard exposure rating is also very high at 7/10.</p>"}
