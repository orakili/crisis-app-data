At least 2.6 million people Haiti are in need of humanitarian assistance as of January 2019, out of which almost 50% are children. The resilience of the population is extremely low, and the political and economic situation is fragile.</p>\n\n<p>Food insecurity persists in Haiti, and is driven by the combined effects of natural hazards and poor socioeconomic conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Haiti continues to fight outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. The diphtheria outbreak began in 2014, while the cholera outbreak started in the aftermath of the destructive earthquake of 2010. Recurring natural disasters, as well as the weakness of Haitiâ€™s health system, are contributing factors to the persistence of these diseases.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Haiti's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster for 2019 to be high at 6.5/10. Lack of Coping Capacity is of particular concern, at 7.4/10.</p>"}
