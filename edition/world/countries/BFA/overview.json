Three groups are active: Ansarul Islam, the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (JNIM), and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). The armed groups are instrumentalising pre-existing tensions between farmers and herders. Rising violence since 2019 had resulted in the displacement of more than 1.5 million people as at December 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing violence, displacement, and COVID-19 have resulted in rising food insecurity. As at 13 November 2021, more than 1.6 million people were estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity between October–December 2021. The situation is likely to worsen in the coming months as over 2.6 million people across the country are likely to be facing severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between June–August 2022 because of depleted food stocks, rising food prices, and low incomes.?</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare needs are high, as access to services is poor and insecurity has led to the suspension of services in several health centres.Access to water is a major issue, particularly in the Sahel and Est regions.
