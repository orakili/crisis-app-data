Insecurity has also pushed Nigerian refugees into Chad since 2014, creating a complex displacement crisis across the islands and shores of Lake Chad. Large and protracted refugee populations, mainly from Sudan and CAR, in the south and east of the country also face significant humanitarian needs. <br>Regional instability coupled with a severe economic crisis and erratic rainfall threaten food security in Chad. Some 3.7 million people are projected to be food insecure in the June-August 2019 period. A measles outbreak beginning May 2018 continues and has intensified in 2019. Since January 2019, more than 15,000 cases of measles have been reported across the country, with approximately 143 fatalities.</p>"}
