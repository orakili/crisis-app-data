As a result, many refugees have sought safety there, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees, about 180,000 Palestinian refugees, and 28,800 Palestinian refugees from Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions between host and refugee populations are frequent as the high number of refugees has put pressure on the already strained Lebanese economy. Food and rent prices have increased, competition for jobs has grown, and there is pressure on the health and education systems. In addition, refugees in Lebanon face significant protection issues, including lack of documentation, evictions, and discrimination. Although the pressure from the government and Hezbollah on Syrians to return to Syria has been increasing, the actual number of returnees remains unknown.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Lebanonâ€™s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be medium, at 5.3/10. Vulnerability is of particular concern, at 6.3/10.</p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian Access</p>\n\n<p>There are no major humanitarian access constraints but the Lebanese government's refusal to formally recognise Syrians' refugee status and the absence of formal refugee camps results in limited humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian actors must usually help Syrian refugees in need with short-term and repetitive responses rather than longer-term strategies.</p>"}
