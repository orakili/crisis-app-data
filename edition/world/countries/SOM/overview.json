The drought is causing significant loss of livelihoods across the country, and widespread displacement. Famine is possible in 2017 if humanitarian assistance is inadequate.&nbsp;Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly&nbsp;inaccessible. The government&#39;s control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. Widespread corruption, elections (September 2016-February 2017) and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of south central Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland. The INFORM index score for risk of humanitarian&nbsp;catastrophe ranks Somalia&nbsp;at&nbsp;9.2&nbsp;out of 10, the highest&nbsp;of any country.<br />&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>09/03</strong>: Measles reportedly killed five children in Sool region</p><p><strong>08/03:</strong>&nbsp;400 cases of cholera were recorded in one day.</p><p><strong>01/03</strong>: Water prices in Garsobore, Gedo have increased 16 times from the start of the drought</p><p><strong>February:&nbsp;</strong>At least 102,000 displaced by drought in February alone.</p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
