A peace deal signed in  November 2016 ended the conflict and the FARC started a Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) process, while other armed groups such as the Ejército Popular de Liberación (EPL) and  Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) reshuffled and are fighting for control of land and illicit crop production in areas vacated by the FARC. Forced displacement and landmine contamination are major humanitarian concerns. Internal displacement is under-registered, due to threats by armed groups against displaced people and officials involved in the registration of IDPs. The departments most affected by displacement are Chocó, Nariño, Valle del Cauca, and Cauca on the Pacific coast, Norte de Santander on the border with Venezuela, and Antioquia. In rural communities, armed group activity restricts movement and limits access to basic health services, crops, and labour markets. Afro-Colombians, indigenous and rural communities are disproportionally affected. Attacks against human rights activists and community leaders by armed groups increased in 2018 and 2019.  Colombia also experiences frequent natural disasters. The rainy season (May-November) typically results in flooding in many regions, putting thousands of people in need of shelter and NFIs. The Caribbean coast and the Andean regions are usually the most affected by floods and landslides.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Colombia's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster for 2019 as High at 5.5/10, a slight increase from 5.4/10 in 2018. Hazard and exposure as well as vulnerability are a particular concern, at 6.8/10 and 6.2/10.</p>"}
